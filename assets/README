I have created the project MakeConnect and set up the folder structure. Here is what each folder is for:

src/: This is the "Source" folder. All our code lives here.
components/: Reusable UI parts like Buttons, Cards, and Headers. If we use it more than once, it goes here.
screens/: The full pages of the app (e.g., LoginScreen, HomeScreen, ProfileScreen).
navigation/: Handles moving between screens (like clicking a button to go to Profile).
services/: Code that talks to the outside world (APIs, Backend). We will put our Mock Data logic here.
utils/: Helper functions (e.g., a function to calculate distance or format dates).
constants/: Fixed values like Colors, FontSizes, and Strings. This makes it easy to change the app's theme later.
assets/: Images, Icons, and Fonts.
data/: This is where we will put our Mock Data (fake users, workers, and chats) for now.
